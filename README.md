# Task Dashboard

Full-stack task management system built with Next.js, TypeScript, Prisma, and PostgreSQL.

This project demonstrates modern full-stack development using a type-safe stack,
structured project organization, and relational database modeling.

---

## 🏗 Overview

Task Dashboard is designed as a structured, production-style application rather than a simple UI demo.

It integrates:

- Next.js App Router for server/client separation
- Prisma ORM for type-safe database interaction
- PostgreSQL for persistent relational storage
- Environment-based configuration
- Modular project organization

The goal of this project is to reflect full-stack architectural awareness while keeping implementation clean and maintainable.

## 📌 Purpose of This Repository

This repository is built as a structured full-stack foundation,
demonstrating practical integration between frontend architecture
and relational database-backed backend logic.

It reflects a production-oriented mindset rather than a tutorial-style implementation.
