# Task Dashboard UI

A scalable task management dashboard built with React and TypeScript.

This project focuses on frontend architecture, state management structure,
and building maintainable UI systems rather than just implementing features.

---

## 🎯 Project Goals

- Design a modular and extensible component architecture
- Implement predictable and scalable state management
- Maintain clean separation between UI, logic, and data layers
- Ensure the system can evolve without structural rewrites

---

## 🧱 Architecture Overview

The project follows a structured frontend architecture:

- Feature-based folder organization
- Isolated component layers
- Centralized state management
- Clear separation between presentation and business logic

This structure allows the application to scale as new features are introduced.

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

- React
- TypeScript
- Zustand / Redux Toolkit
- TailwindCSS
- Vite / Next.js (depending on your setup)

---

## 🧠 Engineering Decisions

### State Management
Global and local state are separated intentionally to reduce unnecessary re-renders and maintain predictability.

### Component Design
Components are structured to minimize tight coupling and encourage reuse.

### Scalability
The architecture supports:
- Adding new task types
- Integrating backend APIs
- Expanding dashboard modules
- Introducing role-based views

---

## 🚀 Potential Extensions

- Backend integration (REST API)
- Authentication & authorization
- Real-time updates
- Analytics dashboard
- Optimistic UI updates

---

## 📌 Why This Project Matters

This repository demonstrates frontend system design principles,
not just UI implementation.

The focus is on writing code that scales with product complexity.
